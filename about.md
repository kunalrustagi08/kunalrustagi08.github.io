title: About
---

I am a proud Indian.
I tried studying for medicine, but it did not work out due to financial issues.
I had to settle for Bachelors in Electronics, having no interest in it.

But, in the final years, I developed a fonding towards learning python and data science.
I plan to self learn and maintain this blog site to motivate myself to learn new things.

I love cricket, watching FIFA and playing Brawl Stars in my free time.

If you want to contact me or talk about anything else like cricket or learn more about me, send me a DM on twitter [here](https://twitter.com/kunalr01) or mail [here](rustagi.kunal@outlook.com)
