I am an Indian, currently in Maharashtra.  
I tried studying for medicine, but it did not work out due to financial issues.  
Later, I did Bachelors in Electronics, having no interest in it and was promised by the college that if I get good grades in First Year, I would be transfered to the Computer Dept. Getting good grades didn't work out as well.

But, since my 6th semester, I developed a fonding towards learning python and data science.  
I plan to write blogs to share my knowledge and my journey.  

I love cricket, watching FIFA and playing Brawl Stars in my free time.

If you want to contact me or talk about anything else like cricket or learn more about me, send me a DM on twitter [here](https://twitter.com/kunalr01) or mail [here](mailto:rustagi.kunal@outlook.com)
