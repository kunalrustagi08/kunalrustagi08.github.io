Hello there!

A favorite quote by *Roy T. Bennett* that I like to remember at all times:
> “It’s only after you’ve stepped outside your comfort zone that you begin to change, grow, and transform.”

I am currently partnering with the Ready Now Foundation, a non-profit org, to build and design an AI course using basic math knowledge for high school students. Apart from that, I am also developing a chatbot with Guardrails for technical support.

I possess a master's degree from **UC San Diego** in Machine Learning and Data Science, and a bachelor's degree from University of Pune in **Electronics and Telecommunications**. Following my interests in Data Science and Analytics, I have worked companies like ZS Associates, Moderna, and a few startups. 

I am actively seeking full-time opportunities within the United States on an immediate basis, so if you have leads, please do not hesitate in reaching out.


<!-- Prior to this, I worked as a Decision Analytics Associate at **ZS Associates**, Pune. My primary tasks involved use of `SQL`, `Python`, and `Tableau` to work on medical claims data and prepare reports for the clients, and use of `Python` to automate certain tasks and QC tests. Previously, I completed my Bachelors in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering at **University of Pune** with 9.22 CGPA.  

During my college years, I worked as an intern on:
* Rainfall nowcasting of severe rainfall events over Mumbai at **Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology**, Pune.
* Sentiment analysis on reviews scraped from various websites using TextBlob at **DigitalMain**, Pune.
* Text-to-speech bot on a Raspberry Pi using gTTS along with a study on Emotion Detection at **Makers' Lab, Tech Mahindra**, Pune.   -->
