I am doing my undergrad at the Electronics and Telecomm Department at [AISSMS IOIT](https://aissmsioit.org/), Pune. I am interested in Digital Image Processing and its applications to different fields.
Currently, I am studying the basic concepts of image processing to build a solid foundation.

In the past, I have done internships on:
* Rainfall nowcasting of severe rainfall events over Mumbai at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune.
* Performed sentiment analysis on reviews scraped from various websites using TextBlob at DigitalMain, Pune.
* Built a text-to-speech bot on a Raspberry Pi using gTTS along with a study on Emotion Detection at Makers' Lab, Tech Mahindra, Pune.
