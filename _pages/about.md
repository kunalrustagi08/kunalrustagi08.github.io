I am an undergrad at the Electronics and Telecomm Dept. at AISSMS IOIT, Pune. My interest lies in Digital Image Processing and the various fields it is used in it.  
Currently, I am revising the basics of image processing in order to build a solid foundation.

A few of my internships include:
* Rainfall nowcasting of severe rainfall events over Mumbai at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune.
* Performed sentiment analysis on reviews scraped from various websites using TextBlob at DigitalMain, Pune.
* Built a text-to-speech bot on a Raspberry Pi using gTTS along with study on Emotion Detection at Makers' Lab, Tech Mahindra, Pune.
