Hello there! 

A favorite quote by *Roy T. Bennett* that I like to remember at all times:
> “It’s only after you’ve stepped outside your comfort zone that you begin to change, grow, and transform.”

I am Decision Analytics Associate at **ZS Associates**, Pune. My primary tasks involve use of `SQL` and `Tableau` to work on medical claims data and prepare reports for the clients, and use of `Python` to automate certain tasks and QC tests. Previously, I completed my Bachelors in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering at **[AISSMS IOIT](https://aissmsioit.org/), Pune University** with 9.22 CGPA.  

During my college years, I worked as an intern on:
* Rainfall nowcasting of severe rainfall events over Mumbai at **Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology**, Pune.
* Sentiment analysis on reviews scraped from various websites using TextBlob at **DigitalMain**, Pune.
* Text-to-speech bot on a Raspberry Pi using gTTS along with a study on Emotion Detection at **Makers' Lab, Tech Mahindra**, Pune.  

Since, I am interested in `Image processing, Development and DevOps`, in my free time, I try to learn work on them. Apart from that, I also like to play table tennis, badmintion, watch informational videos on Youtube, and cook food. I can talk endlessly about Star Wars and Cricket.
