Currently, I work at ZS Associates as a Decision Analytics Associate. I completed my Bachelors in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering at [AISSMS IOIT](https://aissmsioit.org/), Pune University with 9.22 CGPA. In my free time, I try to learn programming, image processing and a few concepts of DevOps.

In the past, I have done internships on:
* Rainfall nowcasting of severe rainfall events over Mumbai at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune.
* Performed sentiment analysis on reviews scraped from various websites using TextBlob at DigitalMain, Pune.
* Built a text-to-speech bot on a Raspberry Pi using gTTS along with a study on Emotion Detection at Makers' Lab, Tech Mahindra, Pune.
