Hello there! (You know what to say)

A favorite quote by *Roy T. Bennett* that I like to remember at all times:
> “It’s only after you’ve stepped outside your comfort zone that you begin to change, grow, and transform.”

I am a graduate student at **UC San Diego**, and majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a specialization in Machine Learning and Data Science. Additionally, I am a Teaching Assistant for COGS 108: Data Science in Practice, and have actively been involved in solving doubts, holding discussions and grading.

Prior to this, I worked as a Decision Analytics Associate at **ZS Associates**, Pune. My primary tasks involved use of `SQL`, `Python`, and `Tableau` to work on medical claims data and prepare reports for the clients, and use of `Python` to automate certain tasks and QC tests. Previously, I completed my Bachelors in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering at **University of Pune** with 9.22 CGPA.  

During my college years, I worked as an intern on:
* Rainfall nowcasting of severe rainfall events over Mumbai at **Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology**, Pune.
* Sentiment analysis on reviews scraped from various websites using TextBlob at **DigitalMain**, Pune.
* Text-to-speech bot on a Raspberry Pi using gTTS along with a study on Emotion Detection at **Makers' Lab, Tech Mahindra**, Pune.  

Since, I am interested in `Data Science, Analytics, DevOps, Software Development`, in my free time, I try to learn work on them. Apart from that, I also like to play table tennis, badminton, watch informational videos on Youtube, and cook food. I can talk endlessly about Star Wars and Cricket.
