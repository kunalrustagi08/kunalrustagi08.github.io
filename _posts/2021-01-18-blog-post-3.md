Recently, I installed Linux Mint 20.1 XFCE Edition on my old laptop and frankly speaking, I kinda like it. While working my around the system, I came to know that pressing the `PrntScr` key opens up an application window. For me, it was new and annoying as I prefer to just press the `Shift + PrntSc` key for selecting the area to screenshot. There is a way you could disable the application launch, just follow these steps:

1. Install `gnome-screenshot`. Run:  
`sudo apt-get install gnome-screenshot`  
2. Move the original to newer place:  
`sudo mv /usr/bin/gnome-screenshot /usr/bin/gnome-screenshot.orig`  
3. Create a modified command: (You may replace the `-af` with `-f` if you want full screenshots.)  
`sudo nano /usr/bin/gnome-screenshot.mod`  
```
#!/bin/sh
gnome-screenshot.orig -af "$HOME/Pictures/Screenshot from $(date '+%F %T').png" $@
```
4. Create an executable:  
`sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/gnome-screenshot.mod`
5. Link it:  
`sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gnome-screenshot.mod /usr/bin/gnome-screenshot`
6. Navigate to Keyboard settings, change the default shortcut for Print from `xfce4-screenshooter` to `gnome-screenshot`.

And done! Enjoy hassle free screenshots!
