Writing this blog, as I always have to look up for various links on the internet to set up Git and SSH keys on a fresh install of an operating system. The following setup is for Linux

1. Install `git`. Run  
`sudo apt install git-all`  
2. Check the version to see if installed correctly  
`git --version`  
3. Setup the configuration file by adding your name and email address  
`git config --global user.name "John Doe"`  
`git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com`
4. Create a new SSH key  
`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "johndoe@example.com"`  
Press enter to select the default location
5. Start the SSH agent in background  
`eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`
6. Now, add the SSH private key to the SSH agent  
`ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
7. Copy the SSH public key  
`cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
8. Add this key to your GitHub account by navigating to the SSH key section in settings
